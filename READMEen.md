## 💻 Usage Examples

### Example Input (Role Constraint Logic)

```

I want to enforce these rules:

* Only one department head per department
* Only one deputy department head per department
* Only one section chief and one assistant section chief per section

Generate MUMPS code to check these constraints.

### GPT Example Output

```mumps
CHKROLE(DEPT,KAKU,YAKU) ; Function to check role constraints
   NEW CNT,MAX
   ; Define max counts per role
   SET MAX("部長")=1, MAX("副部長")=1
   SET MAX("課長")=1, MAX("課長代理")=1

   ; Count existing entries
   SET CNT=$O(^SYST_社員番号(DEPT,KAKU,YAKU,""),-1)
   IF CNT'<MAX(YAKU) QUIT 0
   QUIT 1
````
